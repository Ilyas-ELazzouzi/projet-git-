**To-Do List Project**  
This project is a simple yet effective To-Do List application built using Python. It allows users to add, view, and delete tasks directly from the console, demonstrating my ability to implement core programming concepts like data structures and user input handling. This project highlights my problem-solving skills and my focus on writing clean, maintainable Python code. Check it out to see my approach to creating functional and user-friendly applications!
